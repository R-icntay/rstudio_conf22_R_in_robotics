# Preface {.unnumbered}

Hujambo and welcome to the accompanying guide for our [rstudio::conf(2022)](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/) talk: *`A Touch of R in Robotics`*.

In these series of notebooks, we try as much as possible to provide detailed explanations of the methodologies used along with the corresponding code.

We hope you enjoy it as much as we did ðŸ¤–.
